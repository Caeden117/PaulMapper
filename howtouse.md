1. Select x number of notes **Must not be on the same time**
2. Press f9 to generate paul between selected notes

- if at least two notes are chroma colored it will make a gradient between them  
- if all notes are dots it will make the curve with dots  

- press f7 to change stuff like precision

also works with bombs  

## Vibro
*Still WIP*

- but if set to true in f7 and rotation sat to false  
- when generating using f9 it will make each note changing between up and down
