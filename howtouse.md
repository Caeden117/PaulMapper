# Quick Guide
1. Select x number of notes **Must not be on the same time**
2. Press f9 to generate a paul between the selected notes

- if at least two notes are chroma colored it will make a gradient between them

- if all notes are dots it will make the curve using dots  

- press f7 to change stuff like precision

also works with bombs  

## Tips
- By enabling precision placement in the chromapper settings, you can hold down the designated key *(Q for me)* to place notes more precisely, and this will allow you to more precisly maniupulate how the curve looks.

## Vibro
*Still WIP*

- but if set to true in f7 and rotation sat to false  
- when generating using f9 it will make each note changing between up and down
